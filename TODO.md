# Euphoria POS - Technical Debt & Future Improvements

## Critical Issues for Production

### 1. Port Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: WebSocket server fails if port is already in use. Non-technical staff cannot troubleshoot port conflicts.

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Implement automatic port discovery
  - Try a range of ports (8100-8200) until one works
  - Store the successful port in settings
  - Display actual port in UI for troubleshooting
- [ ] Add port conflict resolution UI
  - Show clear error message: "Another checkout lane is already running"
  - Offer "Run as Lane 2" button that auto-selects next available port
- [ ] Implement port cleanup on app exit
  - Ensure ports are properly released
  - Add graceful shutdown handlers
- [ ] Consider using IPC sockets instead of TCP ports for local communication

### 2. Database Robustness
- [ ] Add database corruption detection and recovery
- [ ] Implement automatic backups (hourly/daily)
- [ ] Add database migration rollback capability
- [ ] Handle "database is locked" errors gracefully
- [ ] Add database size monitoring and alerts

### 3. Sync Reliability
- [ ] Add visual sync status indicator in UI
  - Green: All systems syncing
  - Yellow: Peer sync only (no internet)
  - Red: No sync (offline mode)
- [ ] Implement sync conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Add manual sync trigger button for staff
- [ ] Better handling of network interruptions
- [ ] Queue size monitoring (alert if outbox gets too large)

### 4. Hardware Integration
- [ ] Add hardware device status dashboard
  - Scanner: Connected/Disconnected
  - Printer: Online/Offline/Out of Paper
  - Card Reader: Ready/Not Ready
- [ ] Automatic device reconnection attempts
- [ ] Fallback modes for each device failure
- [ ] Clear user instructions for common issues

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Replace technical error messages with user-friendly ones
- [ ] Add "Report Issue" button that collects logs
- [ ] Implement automatic error recovery where possible
- [ ] Add system health check on startup
- [ ] Clear instructions for common problems

### 6. Staff Training Features
- [ ] Add interactive tutorial mode
- [ ] Built-in help system with screenshots
- [ ] "Training Mode" that doesn't affect real inventory
- [ ] Common tasks checklist for new employees

### 7. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Implement database indexing strategy
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize large transaction handling
- [ ] Implement data archiving for old transactions
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### 8. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add PIN complexity requirements
- [ ] Implement session timeouts
- [ ] Add audit log for all actions
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Add role-based permissions UI

### 9. Deployment & Updates
- [ ] Implement auto-update mechanism
- [ ] Add rollback capability for failed updates
- [ ] Version compatibility checking between lanes
- [ ] Configuration backup/restore

### 10. Monitoring & Diagnostics
- [ ] Add system diagnostics screen
  - Database status
  - Sync queue status
  - Hardware connections
  - Network connectivity
  - Disk space
  - Memory usage
- [ ] Remote monitoring capability
- [ ] Automatic issue detection and alerting

## Nice-to-Have Features

### User Experience

- [ ] Promotional campaign support
- [ ] Gift card balance checking
- [ ] Layaway management
- [ ] Special order tracking

### Reporting
- [ ] Real-time sales dashboard
- [ ] End-of-day reports
- [ ] Inventory alerts
- [ ] Employee performance metrics
- [ ] Customer purchase patterns

### Integration
- [ ] QuickBooks export
- [ ] Email receipt capability
- [ ] SMS customer notifications
- [ ] Supplier catalog import
- [ ] Barcode label printing

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 90%+
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Implement continuous integration
- [ ] Add code quality metrics
- [ ] Document all APIs

### Architecture
- [ ] Implement event sourcing for better audit trail
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add development mode shortcuts
- [ ] Improve error messages for developers
- [ ] Add performance profiling tools
- [ ] Create component library documentation
- [ ] Add database seeding scripts for testing

## Priority Order for Non-Technical Staff Issues

1. **Port Management** - Critical for multi-lane setup
2. **Hardware Status Dashboard** - Staff need to know what's working
3. **Sync Status Indicator** - Visual feedback on system health
4. **User-Friendly Error Messages** - Reduce support calls
5. **Training Mode** - Reduce training time
6. **System Diagnostics Screen** - Self-service troubleshooting

## Implementation Notes

- Each improvement should be tested with actual staff before deployment
- All error messages should suggest concrete actions
- UI changes should be validated with non-technical users
- Consider hiring UX designer for staff-facing features
- Create video tutorials for common issues

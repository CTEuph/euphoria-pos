# Focused Testing Strategy Implementation for Euphoria POS

## Overview
Based on the existing test strategy document, implement a pragmatic testing setup focused on "money paths" and critical business logic, following the established philosophy of testing what matters most in a POS environment.

## Phase 1: Testing Foundation Setup (2-3 hours)

### 1.1 Install Core Testing Dependencies
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @vitest/ui c8
npm install -D @playwright/test 
npm install -D msw
```

### 1.2 Configure Vitest
- Create `vitest.config.ts` with Electron renderer process support
- Set up React Testing Library configuration
- Configure coverage reporting with c8
- Add test scripts to package.json following the strategy doc

### 1.3 Basic Test File Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   └── barcode-scanner.test.ts  # Start with Task 1.1 feature
├── integration/
│   └── scanning-workflow.test.ts
├── mocks/
│   └── electron.ts
└── helpers/
    └── test-utils.ts
```

## Phase 2: Task 1.1 Testing (Current Feature) (3-4 hours)

### 2.1 Unit Tests for Barcode Scanner
**File**: `tests/unit/barcode-scanner.test.ts`
- Test `useBarcodeScanner` hook logic
- Test keyboard shortcut parsing (Shift+J → Jack Daniels)
- Test barcode accumulation and timeout behavior
- Test modal state detection (scanning disabled)
- Test audio feedback triggering

### 2.2 Integration Tests for Scanning Workflow
**File**: `tests/integration/scanning-workflow.test.ts`
- Test complete scan → product lookup → cart addition flow
- Test toast notifications appearing correctly
- Test keyboard shortcuts adding correct products
- Test error handling for unknown barcodes

### 2.3 Mock Setup for Electron APIs
**File**: `tests/mocks/electron.ts`
- Mock Web Audio API for audio feedback testing
- Mock toast system for notification verification
- Basic Electron environment simulation

## Phase 3: Critical Business Logic Testing (4-5 hours)

### 3.1 Checkout Store Testing
**File**: `tests/unit/checkout-store.test.ts`
- Test cart state management (add/remove/update items)
- Test total calculations (subtotal, tax, final total)
- Test computed values updating correctly
- Test cart clearing and reset functionality

### 3.2 Future-Proof Test Structure
Set up test patterns that will be ready for:
- Discount engine testing (Task 1.3)
- Payment logic testing (Task 1.5)
- Customer management testing (Task 1.4)

## Phase 4: Basic E2E Setup (2-3 hours)

### 4.1 Playwright Configuration for Electron
- Configure Playwright to test Electron app
- Set up test data management
- Create helper functions for common POS operations

### 4.2 Critical Path Test (Single Test)
**File**: `tests/e2e/basic-checkout.spec.ts`
- Test: Scan product → verify cart → check totals
- Validates the core POS workflow end-to-end
- Serves as smoke test for releases

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. ✅ **useBarcodeScanner hook testing** - Current feature validation
2. ✅ **Checkout store testing** - Money calculations must be bulletproof
3. ✅ **Audio feedback testing** - Critical UX component
4. ✅ **Basic E2E workflow** - Smoke test for confidence

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
5. **Toast notification testing** - User feedback validation
6. **Keyboard shortcut testing** - Convenience feature validation
7. **Modal state testing** - Prevents scanning conflicts

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
8. **Performance testing** - Can be added later
9. **Hardware simulation** - Needed when real hardware arrives
10. **Security testing** - Important for production but not blocking development

## Test Coverage Goals (Realistic)
- **Barcode Scanner Hook**: 90%+ (critical current feature)
- **Checkout Store**: 90%+ (money calculations)
- **Audio Utilities**: 80%+ (user experience)
- **Integration Workflows**: Key happy paths covered
- **E2E Tests**: One critical path working

## Success Metrics
1. **Task 1.1 fully tested** - All barcode scanner functionality validated
2. **CI/CD ready** - Tests run on every commit
3. **Developer confidence** - Can refactor without fear
4. **Foundation established** - Easy to add tests for future features

## Benefits
- **Immediate value**: Validates current barcode scanner implementation
- **Future-ready**: Test patterns established for upcoming features  
- **Confidence building**: Developers can iterate faster with test safety net
- **Quality assurance**: Critical POS functionality is verified automatically
